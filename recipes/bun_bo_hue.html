<h2>A meat-laden soup from Central Vietnam.</h2>
<p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>6 cloves garlic, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>2 medium shallots, quartered</li>
    <li>4 stalks lemongrass</li>
    <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons crushed red pepper</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons fish sauce, or more to taste</li>
    <li>4 1/2 teaspoons sugar, plus more to taste</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>4 cups low-sodium beef broth</li>
    <li>12 ounces vermicelli rice noodles</li>
    <li>8 ounces boneless top blade steak, connective tissue removed, meat sliced thinly across the grain</li>
    <li>1/2 small white onion, thinly sliced and soaked in ice water for 20 minutes</li>
    <li>1/2 cup packed cilantro leaves, roughly chopped</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Cut the tops off the lemongrass stalks, about 6 inches from the base. Bruise the tops with something heavy, like
        a meat mallet, and reserve for the broth. Peel off 2 or 3 of the woody outer layers from the base stalks until
        you reach the smoother, more tender core. Roughly chop the stalks and put in a food processor along with the
        garlic and shallots. Pulse about 20 times until everything is finely chopped, but not a paste.</li>
    <li>Heat the vegetable oil over medium heat in a large saucepan. Add the chopped lemongrass mixture and cook until
        soft and starting to brown, about 6 minutes. Add the crushed red pepper and stir for 1 minute. Add 2 tablespoons
        fish sauce, 4 teaspoons sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture has
        thickened slightly, a spoon dragged across the pan leaves a trail and the oil is starting to separate from the
        solids. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the lemongrass mixture from the pan and reserve.</li>
    <li>Add the beef broth, 4 cups of water, and the bruised lemongrass tops to the saucepan. Bring to a boil and reduce
        to
        a simmer. Cook until it tastes like lemongrass, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Turn off the heat and add the vermicelli noodles. Cook,
        stirring periodically, until tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain very well and divide among 4 large soup bowls.</li>
    <li>Add the remaining tablespoon fish sauce, 1/2 teaspoon sugar and 3/4 teaspoon salt to the beef broth. Remove the
        lemongrass tops. Add the steak slices and gently simmer until no longer pink, about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Top each bowl with slices of cooked beef, the white onion and cilantro. Pour hot broth into the bowls to
        completely cover the noodles.</li>
    <li>Serve with the reserved lemongrass-chile mixture and suggested garnishes on the side.</li>
